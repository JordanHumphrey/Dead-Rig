### Merge Request Rules
1.) Any push to the maaster branch will only be approved if it does not break the current working version of the game.

2.) Merge conflicts should be resolved via looking between differences in code, determining if your change has better results, or fixes a known bug.

3.) If a bug is not known/unknown but presents itself, write it down in the Bug-Report.md along with the date of entry and information such as file, scene #, and effects it is having.

4.) If a bug is fixed, leave a detailed update in Bug-Report.md with same as above, and also your signature on its fix in the code as a comment.

5.) Merge-Requests will be checked/accepted every night at 12pm Midnight. Refusals will be chatted in discord explaining reasoning.
